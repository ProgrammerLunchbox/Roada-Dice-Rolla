Hello my friend, My name is Lunchbox and I'm an aspiring programmer. 
This is my first real attempt at making something so its very rough.
If you have any tips that I can use to improve it I would great,y appreciate it.
I own a discord with professional developers as mods and would love to 
add more people to both help, teach and learn together.
